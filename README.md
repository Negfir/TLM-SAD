# Assignment 1

The Un-timed model is available in the "Untimed" folder and the Timed model is available in the "Timed" folder. 

"Test" folder contains test.cpp file which is a simple c++ code to generate golden outputs, and can be used for testing the results of TLM models.

## Running TLM Models

To run the code, you can cd in each folder and use their own Makefile.

```bash
% make
% ./SAD mem_init.txt
```

There is also a vcd file for the timed model that traces the waveforms generated by the modules.
